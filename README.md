# HandlingMulticollinearity

Multicollinearity is a statistical phenomenon that occurs when two or more independent variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated. In other words, these variables exhibit a strong linear relationship, making it difficult to isolate the individual effects of each variable on the dependent variable.
